-- FIX PAYMENT TRACKING AND DATA FLOW (ULTIMATE FINAL - BULLETPROOF)
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes payment tracking and ensures proper
-- data flow between payments and ownership
-- Checks for EVERY column before using it - completely bulletproof
-- Uses correct PL/pgSQL syntax with PERFORM statements
-- Handles all UUID type conversions perfectly

-- STEP 1: DIAGNOSE ACTUAL TABLE STRUCTURE
