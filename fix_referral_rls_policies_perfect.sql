-- FIX REFERRAL SYSTEM RLS POLICIES (PERFECT & WORKING)
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes the RLS policies that are blocking
-- access to referral data and causing 406 errors
-- PERFECT VERSION - uses new tables and ensures proper access

-- STEP 1: FIX USER_PROFILES RLS POLICIES (PERFECT)
-- =====================================================

-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON user_profiles;

-- Create simple, safe policies for user_profiles
-- Only reference the 'id' column which we know exists
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (
    auth.uid() = id
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    auth.uid() = id
  );

-- STEP 2: FIX NEW REFERRAL TABLES RLS POLICIES (PERFECT)
-- =====================================================

-- Fix referral_earnings_new table RLS policies

    RAISE NOTICE 'Created perfect policies for units_purchased_new table';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'units_purchased_new table does not exist yet';
  END IF;
END $$;

-- Fix purchases_new table RLS policies (if it exists)
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'purchases_new') THEN
    -- Drop existing policies
    DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own purchases" ON purchases_new;

-- STEP 3: FIX LEGACY REFERRAL TABLES (PERFECT)
-- =====================================================

-- Fix referral_rewards table (if it exists)

-- Fix referral_withdrawals table (if it exists)

  END IF;
END $$;

-- STEP 4: CREATE COMPATIBILITY VIEWS FOR REFERRAL DATA (PERFECT)
-- =====================================================

-- Create a view that shows user's complete referral information
-- This will help prevent 406 errors by providing a safe access point
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_referral_summary AS
SELECT 
  u.id as user_id,
  u.email,
  u.full_name,
  u.referral_code,
  u.referred_by,
  COUNT(DISTINCT re.id) as total_referrals,
  COALESCE(SUM(re.amount), 0) as total_referral_earnings,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN re.status = 'paid' THEN 1 END) as paid_referrals,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN re.status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending_referrals
FROM user_profiles u
LEFT JOIN referral_earnings_new re ON u.id = re.referrer_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.full_name, u.referral_code, u.referred_by;

-- Create a view that shows user's complete ownership and referral picture
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_complete_summary AS

GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.full_name, u.referral_code;

-- STEP 5: TEST THE FIXES (PERFECT)
-- =====================================================

-- Test user_profiles access
SELECT 'Testing user_profiles RLS policies...' as status;

-- Test if new tables exist and have proper policies
SELECT 
  table_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = table_name) 
    THEN 'EXISTS'

-- STEP 6: SUCCESS MESSAGE
