            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
                Subx is a real estate Sub-ownership and digital land banking platform, operated and managed by Focal Point Property Development & Management Services Ltd. ("Focal Point", "we", "our", "us"). By subscribing to any Subx project, you agree to these Terms and Conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Eligibility</strong><br/>
                You must be at least 18 years of age and legally capable of entering into a binding agreement to subscribe to any Subx land project.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ownership Structure</strong><br/>
                Subx allows users to subscribe to fractional units of land, starting from as low as one square meter.<br/>
                Each subscription represents a proportional interest in a defined parcel of land under the Subx platform.<br/>
                The full land parcel is held in trust by Focal Point on behalf of all verified Sub-owners until maturity or agreed resale.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Minimum Holding Period</strong><br/>
                All Subx ownership is subject to a mandatory 2-year holding period from the date of subscription confirmation.<br/>
                During this period, owners cannot initiate withdrawals or resell their shares outside the terms defined by Subx.<br/>
                At the end of the 2 years, owners may:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                  <li>Vote to sell the land collectively and receive proportional returns</li>
                  <li>Renew the ownership period (if offered)</li>
                  <li>Transfer ownership (subject to approval and internal procedures)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Documentation & Allocation</strong><br/>
                Upon successful subscription and full payment, users will receive:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                  <li>A digital receipt of payment</li>
                  <li>A Sub-ownership deed indicating their share</li>
                  <li>A digital allocation confirmation (if applicable for that project)</li>
                </ul>
                Physical allocation or site access may be made available based on group agreement and project-specific guidelines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Management Rights</strong><br/>
                Focal Point remains the sole manager and operator of all land under Subx until maturity or resale.<br/>
                We reserve the right to:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">

                  <li>Make operational decisions in the best interest of the Sub-owners</li>
                  <li>Deduct agreed management fees (disclosed before subscription)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Exit and Returns</strong><br/>
                Upon maturity (2 years), Focal Point will:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                  <li>Facilitate sale or exit options</li>
                  <li>Distribute returns based on the final sale value, after management and operational deductions</li>
                </ul>
                Returns are not guaranteed and depend on market value appreciation and group decisions.
              </li>
