              For years we have heard it said that land never depreciates, that the best investment you can make is land. And that is true. But it is only true if you can actually afford the land that you are buying.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The reality is that many people rush into land purchases they cannot sustain. Instead of building wealth, they end up broke. And sometimes they even lose the land altogether.

              The Pain Point of Buying Land
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Some people pay beyond their means. A full plot of land in Lagos or Ogun State can go for millions of naira. People stretch themselves financially to buy it. After paying, they are empty. No liquidity. No emergency funds. No savings. Just land.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The challenge is that land banking does not pay you immediately. When you buy land for banking, you are not collecting rent. You are not running a business. You are simply keeping it until it appreciates. That means the land is not putting food on your table in the short term. If you tie down all your money and you cannot afford it, you feel the weight.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Then there are the additional costs. Buying land is just step one. You still need to process your documents. You need your Certificate of Occupancy, your Deed of Assignment, your survey plan. You may need to fence the property to secure it. Sometimes there are development levies. If you cannot afford these extra steps, you may lose the land. And when you lose it, you lose your investment.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Some people do not even get that far. They cannot even start because they don't have enough to buy a full plot. They want to invest. They know land appreciates. But they are cut off from the opportunity.
            </p>

                    <p>
                      Traditional land buying requires massive upfront capital, ongoing maintenance costs, and ties up all your liquidity. This approach leaves many investors broke and unable to sustain their investment.

              Missing Out on Capital Gains
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              When you cannot buy land, you miss out. You miss out on capital appreciation. Land in growing areas doubles and triples in value within a few years. You miss out on stability. Land is tangible and secure compared to volatile assets like stocks or crypto. You miss out on generational wealth, because families pass land down to their children.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              So whether you buy land and go broke, or you cannot buy at all, the result is the same. You lose the chance that land gives.

              Subx: A Smarter Way to Own Land
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This is where Subx comes in.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              For the very first time in Nigeria, Africa and possibly the world, you don't need to buy a full plot of 500 square meters. With Subx, you can buy from as little as <strong className="text-green-600">one square meter</strong>.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You can start small. One square meter. Ten square meters. Fifty square meters. As your finances grow, you can scale up to one hundred, two hundred, even five hundred square meters.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This means you can own land without going broke. You can diversify your portfolio. You can balance between stocks, crypto, business and land, without overstretching yourself.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              And you are not cut off from the normal documents. You still get your Certificate of Ownership. You still get your Deed of Sale. You still get your receipts. Just like every other landowner.

              The difference is that you are buying within your reach. And when the land appreciates and is sold after the agreed years, you enjoy the capital gain. You enjoy it without the fear of losing the land. And without risking all your money.
