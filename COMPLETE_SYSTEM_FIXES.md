  v_commission_amount DECIMAL;
BEGIN
  -- Get referrer ID
  SELECT referred_by INTO v_referrer_id 
  FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = p_referred_user_id;
  
  -- Calculate 5% commission
  v_commission_amount := p_purchase_amount * 0.05;
  
  -- Create referral reward record
  INSERT INTO referral_rewards (
    referrer_id, referred_id, amount_referred, 
    commission_amount, status
  ) VALUES (
    v_referrer_id, p_referred_user_id, p_purchase_amount, 
    v_commission_amount, 'completed'
  );
  
  -- Update referrer's wallet
  UPDATE user_profiles 
  SET wallet_balance = COALESCE(wallet_balance, 0) + v_commission_amount
